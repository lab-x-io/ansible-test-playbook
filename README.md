## Features

- A Docker-based testing environment leveraging the `devxio/ansible:v1.0.0` container.
- Quick and simple setup, allowing you to focus on playbook development.
- A handy alias for executing Ansible commands within the Docker container.
- Real-time development and testing capabilities by binding your local Ansible directory to the container.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lab-x-io/ansible-test-playbook.git
   cd ansible-test-playbook
   ```

2. **Set Up the Alias**:
   
   Add the following alias to your shell configuration (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   alias ansible="docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/ansible devxio/ansible:v1.0.0"
   ```

   Reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Run Ansible Commands**:
   
   With the alias set, you can now use the `ansible` command in your terminal as if it were installed locally. The command runs inside the Docker container and operates on your bound directory.

## Usage

The magic lies in the simplicity! With the alias set up, you can use the `ansible` command just like you would if it were installed on your machine. The `ansible-test-playbook` repository is designed to be your working directory. As you develop and test playbooks, they operate within the Docker container, ensuring consistency.
